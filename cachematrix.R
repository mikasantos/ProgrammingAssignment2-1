## special "matrix" 
## makeCacheMatrix function basically makes a special "matrix" object that can store its inverse for the data

## The goal in this activity is to create a couple of functions that restore or cache the inverse of a matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
inv <- NULL
set <- function(y) {
x <<- y
inv <<- NULL
        
        
}
        
get <- function() x
setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
getInverse <- function() inv
list(set = set,get = get,setInverse = setInverse,getInverse = getInverse)
}



## cacheSolve is a function that register the inverse of the special "matrix" restored by makeCacheMatrix. 
On the off chance that the inverse has been computed, at that point the cacheSolve ought to recover the inverse out of the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
inv <- x$getInverse()
if (!is.null(inv)) {
message("getting cached data")
return(inv)}
mat <- x$get()
inv <- solve(mat, ...)
x$setInverse(inv)
inv}
